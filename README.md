# Addie's Birthday Page
Some front end practice and a birthday surprise for my niece's 5th. This is just some playing around as I'm learning and I'm putting it up here so that I can access it easily. If I finish in time I'll include my JS 13K Game. If not I'll add one before her birthday.

I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with this little project. Don't judge too harshly as this is some fun for a 5 year old and not meant to be professional. Yes I used Comic Sans and text animations. Yes, I know it looks like it was created by a 13 year old in the '90s. That's sort of the point.

Feel free to branch and adjust if you want. You can change the name in the index.html file for a girl's birthday or use a different javascript game. 

When my nephew gets a little older I'll add to this to make a boy's version. Of course by then I'll probably be well beyond this level.
